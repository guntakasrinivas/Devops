echo "$Nani: $Ammulu, why do you always say “later” and then never do it?"
echo "$Ammulu: Because when I say “now,” you start overthinking everything $Nani."
echo "$Nani: That’s not overthinking. That’s planning $Ammulu."
echo "$Ammulu: No, that’s you turning one simple thing into ten problems $Nani."
echo "$Nani: Someone has to think ahead $Ammulu. You just wing it and hope it works."
echo "$Ammulu: And guess what? Most of the time, it does work $Nani."
echo "$Nani: Until it doesn’t $Ammulu. Then I’m the one fixing it."
echo "$Ammulu: True. But without me, you’d never start anything $Nani."
echo "$Nani: …annoyingly accurate."
echo "$Ammulu: See? We’re a team. You worry, I move $Nani."
echo "$Nani: Fine. But next time, we meet in the middle $Ammulu."
echo "$Ammulu: Deal. No “later,” and no overplanning $Nani."
