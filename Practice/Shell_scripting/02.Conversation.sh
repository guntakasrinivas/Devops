echo "Nani: Ammulu, why do you always say “later” and then never do it?

echo "Ammulu: Because when I say “now,” you start overthinking everything."
echo "Nani: That’s not overthinking. That’s planning."
echo "Ammulu: No, that’s you turning one simple thing into ten problems."
echo "Nani: Someone has to think ahead. You just wing it and hope it works."
echo "Ammulu: And guess what? Most of the time, it does work."
echo "Nani: Until it doesn’t. Then I’m the one fixing it."
echo "Ammulu: True. But without me, you’d never start anything."
echo "Nani: …annoyingly accurate."
echo "Ammulu: See? We’re a team. You worry, I move."
echo "Nani: Fine. But next time, we meet in the middle."
echo "Ammulu: Deal. No “later,” and no overplanning."
